# In-Place Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

# Project Description
This application helps the user visualize what various in-place sorting algorithms are doing to sort a given array. Using specified keyboard letters, the user can choose the algorithm they'd like to view, the sorting order (ascending/descending), and the speed at which the visualizer sorts the array. 

As I am currently new to the world of coding/developing, the motivation for this project was to get practice coding using concepts I have learned while at the same time creating something tangeble I can showcase and speak to. I have started my coding journey with Python so that is the language in which this project is coded. 

The base of this project is a code-along tutorial from Tim Ruscica's YouTube channel, Tech With Tim (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twRidO-_vqQ). I expanded on this and added another algorithm as well as a way to change the speed at which the visualizer sorts the array. Figuring out how to structure the project and how to visualize the algorithm was a challenging learning opportunity. I have another algorithm I am trying to include as well; however, the algorithm is recursive which is making the visualization methodology a little more difficult to execute.

# How To Use The Visualizer
At the top of the window, there are setting options and a text display of selected options. To visualize an algorithm, perform the following:
*Select the algorithm you would like to visualize by pressing the corresponding letter on the keyboard.
*Select the sorting order (ascending or descending) by pressing the corresponding letter on the keyboard.
*Select the speed at which you would like the visualizer to sort the array by pressing any number from 1 - 9.
*Once all desired setting are selected, press the spacebar to start the visualization.
*None of the setting can be changed once the visualization has started; however, it can be reset at any time by pressing 'R' on the keyboard.
